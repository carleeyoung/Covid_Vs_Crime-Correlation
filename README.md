# COVID-19 | Crime | Populations A look at KCMO Zip Codes

## Overview

### The Mahomies decided to collect data for Kansas City, MO on its COVID-19 cases, crime cases and population per zip code. Using SQLAlchemy, we sourced all of our data and created a SQL dataframe that we could leverage when creating our visualizations. Utilizing Flask 1.0 we created a webpage to house our visual representations of our findings. Performing and API call to our SQLAlchemy database, we read in the data needed to build our scatter and bar charts. 
To build the map,  chloropleth.js documentation and geoJSON data of the KCMO zip codes with population and covid cases added (expertly by Dylan and Trevor).  We utilized D3 to add a legend and tooltip for functionality.
